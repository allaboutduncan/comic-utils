### Rename All Files in a Directory

In all directory listings, you'll see a blue icon button that will "Rename All Files" in that directory.

Clicking this will run the same renaming functions detailed on [editor.md](../directory-features/editor.md "mention"). This let's you easily run this feature as you are browsing your folders of if you manually add bulk issues or don't use the [folder-monitoring](../folder-monitoring/ "mention") features.

### Remove Characters from Files

You can now remove characters from groups of files while browsing a directory. If there are files present, you will see a "Remove Text from Filenames" button. Clicking this will bring up a modal and prompt for the characters to remove. Include any spaces you want removed as well.

In this example, I want to update all files and remove the " v1" from the titles.

Click preview once you have your text entered and the app will show a preview of the results. If the naming is as you would like, click the "Execute Rename" and the app will update all of the files, provide a summary and then close the modal.
