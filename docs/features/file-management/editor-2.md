# Delete

### Delete Files

You can see in the example above, we have 2 files that are the same, with slightly different naming conventions. To remove one of the files, simply click the :wastebasket: (Trash) icon and you'll be presented with a confirmation - to ensure you don't accidentally delete an item.

Once you confirm the file delete, the UI will refresh with the new file list.

### Delete Directories

Deleting directories works in the same way - but will remove ALL FILES and the directory itself.
