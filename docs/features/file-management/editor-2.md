# Delete

### Delete Files

You can see in the example above, we have 2 files that are the same, with slightly different naming conventions. To remove one of the files, simply click the :wastebasket: (Trash) icon and you'll be presented with a confirmation - to ensure you don't accidentally delete an item.

After confirming the delete, the file is removed from the UI and directory.

### Delete Directories

Deleting directories works in the same way - but will remove ALL FILES and the directory itself.

### Delete Multiple Files

You can CTRL+Click or SHIFT+Click to select multiple files. Once you have multiple files selected, the UI will show what options you have.

You can see we have 4 files selected. Right-clicking will show you the option to "Delete Selected Files"

Clicking that option will show you the files that will be deleted and ask you to confirm.

Clicking "Delete All" will delete the files. The modal will close and the files will be removed from the directory and the UI.
