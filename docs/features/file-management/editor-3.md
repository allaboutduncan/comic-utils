# Additional Features

### Directory Filtering

For any directory that has more than more than 25 folders, you can now start typing to filter the list. This does not search within the directories, this just quickly narrows down your results.

### Search

Search your Comic folders to see if you have a particular issue or to see if you want to look for a better file. Search performance will be dependent on your library size until the cache is built.

When you start the app, a Search Cache will be built. Timing on this will be dependent on your library. During testing, a library with 100,000 files indexed in about 6-minutes. This will speed up search results.\
\
Search will also run in real-time, but be warned, if you have a large library, it will likely time out before returning any valid results. Additionally, anytime you move files to this directory, the cache will be invalidated.

See the Cache Management section on [app-settings](../app-settings/ "mention") for more details

### File & Folder Sizes

When viewing folders, you can click the _**info icon**_ and CLU will scan the folder and return the size and file count. This is done on request, as providing that data in the list would increase load time significantly.&#x20;

When browsing files, you'll also see file size next to each file. This allows you compare two files, allowing you to see if a newer file was larger / better quality than an existing file.

### View Cover, Meta-Data and ComicInfo.xml

Additionally, you'll see a new **info icon** next to all comics as well. Clicking this will open a modal window and the cover, meta-data and ComicInfo.xml data (if available) will be displayed.
