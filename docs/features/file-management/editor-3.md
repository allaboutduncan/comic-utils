# Additional Features

### Directory Filtering

For any directory that has more than more than 25 folders, you can now start typing to filter the list. This does not search within the directories, this just quickly narrows down your results.

### File & Folder Sizes

When viewing folders, you can click the _**info icon**_ and CLU will scan the folder and return the size and file count. This is done on request, as providing that data in the list would increase load time significantly.&#x20;

When browsing files, you'll also see file size next to each file. This allows you compare two files, allowing you to see if a newer file was larger / better quality than an existing file.

### View Cover, Meta-Data and ComicInfo.xml

Additionally, you'll see a new **info icon** next to all comics as well. Clicking this will open a modal window and the cover, meta-data and ComicInfo.xml data (if available) will be displayed.
