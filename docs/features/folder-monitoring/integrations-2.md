# Monitoring Logs

Once enabled and configured, you'll see a Monitor Logs link in your app navigation.

This will let you view log messages associated specifically with Folder Monitoring. Navigating to this page you should see something like this:

Folder Monitoring uses some of the base functions of the app to perform actions. Logs related to these actions (renaming, conversion, etc) are visible on the App Logs page.

In the example above, we can see a few things:

* **Config Reloaded:** Monitoring continually checks for config file changes to ensure it's always running the most recent config.
* **Processing File:** The file currently being processed
* **Waiting For:** App detects file is being updated, so it waits to do other actions
* **Renamed:** The file before:after renaming&#x20;
* **Moved File:** The file location before:after moving
* **Checking If:** Checking if file is a CBR and needs conversion
* **Sending Convert Request:** File being sent for conversion
