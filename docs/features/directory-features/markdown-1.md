# Rebuild All Files

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-02-25 at 1.54.06â€¯PM.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Rebuild Directory</p></figcaption></figure>

This utility does 2 things:

1. Convert all RAR / CBR files to CBZ
2. Rebuild all ZIP / CBZ files

I often see, in both newer and older files, that Komga doesn't recognize or scan them correctly.&#x20;

More often than not, rebuilding them corrects the error. This option will rebuild all files in a directory (RAR/CBR/ZIP/CBZ --> CBZ)

{% hint style="info" %}
If the app fails to unpack a CBZ file, it will attempt to extraxt using RAR. I have encountered files where they were CBR files with the extension incorrectly renamed to CBZ instead of being properly converted. The app will account for that during any unpack/re-pack operation.
{% endhint %}

For PDF conversions - see the next function
