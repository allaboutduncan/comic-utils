# Rebuild All Files

This utility does 2 things:

1. Convert all RAR / CBR files to CBZ
2. Rebuild all ZIP / CBZ files

I often see, in both newer and older files, that Komga doesn't recognize or scan them correctly.&#x20;

More often than not, rebuilding them corrects the error. This option will rebuild all files in a directory (RAR/CBR/ZIP/CBZ --> CBZ)

For PDF conversions - see the next function
