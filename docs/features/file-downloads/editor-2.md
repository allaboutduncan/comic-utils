<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-05-28 090426.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Current Download Status</p></figcaption></figure>

From this page you can view current and pending downloads.

#### **Download Queue**

Downloads are queued in the order they are received. Downloads are restricted to 3 at a time. When one download finishes, the next in the queue will start.

Once a download is started, the Filename and File Size/Downloaded fields will populate. Prior to starting, downloads currently show "N/A" for file details.

#### Status

This will show one of the following statuses:

* queued
* in\_progress
* error
* complete

#### Cancel

Before a download starts or while in progress, you can cancel a download. Once cancelled, the details are still present until you click the "Clear Completed / Cancelled Downloads" button
