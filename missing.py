def check_missing_issues(root_directory):
    """
    Recursively scans 'root_directory' (including sub-directories) for 
    filenames in one of these forms:
        <Series Name> <Issue Number> (<Year>).cbz
        <Series Name> <Issue Number> (<Year>).cbr
        <Series Name> <Issue Number>.cbz
        <Series Name> <Issue Number>.cbr

    When multiple files in the same directory have the same series name, 
    but some include a year and others do not, they are treated as the 
    same series, adopting the year if at least one file has it.

    Any filename containing any of the substrings in IGNORE (case-insensitive)
    is skipped. We also normalize curly quotes ('’‘“”) to straight quotes 
    ('"') before checking.

    All missing issues (e.g., #003, #004) are written to a single 
    'missing.txt' in 'root_directory'. If a consecutive run of missing issues
    is 50 or more, a single condensed line is used to report that run.

    Now updated to print the directory path once (for each series) only if
    there are missing issues for that series.
